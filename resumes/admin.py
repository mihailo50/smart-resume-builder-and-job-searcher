from django.contrib import admin

# Models are stored in Supabase, not Django ORM
# Admin panel can be used for other Django admin tasks if needed

# If you want to use Django admin for Supabase data, you'll need to:
# 1. Create custom admin views that use Supabase services
# 2. Or use Supabase dashboard at https://supabase.com/dashboard
